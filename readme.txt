Manage WP Job Manager companies with BePro Listings. Use this addon to relate and show jobs created with WP Job Manager, on their BePro Listings company pages

== Description ==
The BePro Listings pluin is used for adding company listings to your website. The WP Job Manager plugin is used for adding job listings to your website. This plugin joins the 2 when activated, in a few important ways

On the WP Job Manager submission page, you will notice some fields are removed and new fields added. One important addition is a list of all companies you created in BePro Listings as a dropdown.

Another important addition is that when you submit your job posting, information from BePro Listings is added to the job posting like the company logo. Also, a link to the company's page on your website is added. This is great for SEO since you are interlinking. More importantly, your customers can easily find the company listing where all other jobs for that company are listed as well as the company details.
